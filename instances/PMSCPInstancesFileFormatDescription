The PMSCP instances format is as follows:

Drill Moving Cost = 500
Number Of Blocks  = 15625
Number Of Groups  = 100
s x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 drillCost group ei|gi ... en|gn
s x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 drillCost group ei|gi ... en|gn
...
s x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 drillCost group ei|gi ... en|gn

Drill Moving Cost is the cost of a group (all groups have the same cost). 

Each line starting with s represents a set (drill hole) where:

* drillCost: The cost of the drill hole (set).
* group: The id of the group that contains the current set.
* ei: The id of the current element
* gi: The gain associated with ei
